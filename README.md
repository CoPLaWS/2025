# CoPLaWS 2025 - the 3rd Copenhagen Programming Languages Workshop

[CoPLaWS](https://coplaws.github.io) is a series of annual workshops for programming language researchers working in the greater Copenhagen area, open to academics (DTU, KU, ITU, RUC, AAU CPH) and researchers in industry and other institutions. The aim is to get together and learn about each other's work.

**[CoPLaWS 2025](https://coplaws.github.io/2025)** is the third edition of the workshop. It will take place on  

- **Friday 22 August 2025** in **Copenhagen** at **[Aalborg University Copenhagen, Konferencesalen (A. C. Meyers Vænge 15, room number 1.001b)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QhL3DdXiMjMqgmVw5)**. 

It will be a full-day event with an optional dinner. For information on the dinner see below.

## Invited Speaker

**[Thomas Jensen (INRIA and University of Copenhagen)](https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Thomas.Jensen/)**

**Title:** Program analysis for software security

**Abstract:** Program analysis is an important tool for enhancing the security of
software. Examples include analyses for enforcing memory protection,
control flow integrity, and correct flow of confidential
information. This talk will provide a (necessarily partial) overview
of the large panorama of analyses and their uses. Because program
analyses are cornerstones of many security architectures, their
correctness becomes critical. The second part of the talk will provide
examples of how programming language semantics can be used to verify
formally the correctness of security analysers.

## Call for Talks 

We invite the submission of abstracts for two kinds of talks:

- 20-minute talks
- maximum 10-minute "short talks"

We encourage also PhD students to submit proposals of either kind! We encourage also presentations of work-in-progress research!

Since there are many programming language researchers in Copenhagen, it is likely that we will get more talk proposals than can fit in a day. In that event, the talks will be selected by the organisers based on a light reviewing process. We will aim for diversity in topics and institutions represented. 

Talk proposals should consist of a title and a one-paragraph abstract. No need to submit any PDF.

## CoPLaWS Dinner 
Assuming that the attendance number is similar to previous years, the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University will be able to pay for the CoPLaWS dinner. 
The dinner will start 18:30 at [Madklubben København, Store Kongensgade 66](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C1YPPPQyyEfsh6Qd6).
You sign up for the dinner through the "Participation registration link" above.
In case of an abnormally large attendance number, we will have to change this plan, and we will let you know
as soon as possible after the registration deadline.
